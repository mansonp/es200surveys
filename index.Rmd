# What Are Surveys?

- Qualitative AND/OR Quantitative
- Many Types: Interviews, Questionnaires
- Respondent Focus - Who Completes Them
- Many Modes: In-person, Door-to-Door, Intercept, Mail, Phone, Online
- Allow for inferences from Sample to Population

--

###When Not to Use Surveys

- Research Questions are Emergent
- Various Sources of <br> Bias or Error Overwhelm
- Population Hard to Reach

# The Why: Theory Rules Everything


---
# The Why: Developing Causal Relationships

## `r emo::ji("thinking")` What is a cause and effect you are interested in? What is the Theory?

--

- `r emo::ji("earth")` Climate change beliefs are determined by party identification

- `r emo::ji("evergreen_tree")` Support for protecting natural areas is predicted by frequent visitation or use

- `r emo::ji("whale")` Support for marine protected areas is driven by concerns over loss of marine health

- Other ideas?

---

# The Why: Developing Causal Relationships

## `r emo::ji("thinking")` What would you ask to test these relationships?

--

-  `r emo::ji("earth")` Do you believe climate change is happening? `r emo::ji("right_arrow")` <br> **Varies by party identification**<br> 

-  `r emo::ji("evergreen_tree")` Willingness to pay for protecting open space, expressed in dollars.  `r emo::ji("right_arrow")` <br> **Varies by visit frequency** 
-  `r emo::ji("whale")` Hypothetical vote for expanding marine protected areas `r emo::ji("right_arrow")` <br> **Varies by perception on marine health** 

- Other ideas?

# The Who: Getting People to Participate

## We *could* just ask everyone! (aka Census)
- Time intensive
- Expensive
- Might actually be less accurate! (Might...)

## Sampling Approaches
- Random 
   - Pure Random, Stratified, Systematic
- Purposive and Quota 
- Intercept
- Snowball 
- Convenience 

???

Census can be less accurate if it has systematic errors in coverage that the sample approach can directly address!

---
# Sample Method Drives Inferences

- Random sample allows for inference from sample to population
- Samples need to be carefully drawn:
   - **Population**: (Universe) Definition: Who do we want to Represent?
   - **Frame**: How we Find our Sample
   - **Sample**: Drawn from Frame, assuming proper *coverage*
   
## Remember Unit of Analysis

- Is it the individual? The household? A firm or organization?
-
   
## Sources of Error

- **Coverage Error**: The Frame has a mismatch!
- **Sampling Error**: Size, Response Rates

# The Who: Sampling and Recruitment

# How Many Surveys Do we Need?

```{r sample, echo=FALSE}

dillmansamplesize <- read_excel("data/dillmansamplesize.xlsx", 
    col_types = c("text", "numeric", "numeric", 
        "numeric", "numeric", "numeric", 
        "numeric")) 

dillmansamplesize %>%
   kbl(col.names = c("Population Size",
                     "50-50",
                      "80-20",
                      "50-50",
                      "80-20",
                      "50-50",
                      "80-20")) %>%
   kable_styling() %>%
   add_header_above(c("95% Conf Level " = 1, "10% MOE" = 2, "5% MOE" = 2, "3% MOE" = 2)) %>%
   column_spec(1, width = "30em") %>%
   column_spec(2:7, width = "20em") %>%
   footnote(general = "From Dillman et al 2009", general_title = "")
```

???
The confidence interval is the plus-or-minus figure usually reported in newspaper or television opinion poll results. For example, if you use a confidence interval of 4 and 47% percent of your sample picks an answer you can be “sure” that if you had asked the question of the entire relevant population between 43% (47-4) and 51% (47+4) would have picked that answer.

The confidence level tells you how sure you can be. It is expressed as a percentage and represents how often the true percentage of the population who would pick an answer that lies within the confidence interval. The 95% confidence level means you can be 95% certain; the 99% confidence level means you can be 99% certain. Most researchers work for a 95% confidence level.

When you put the confidence level and the confidence interval together, you can say that you are 95% sure that the true percentage of the population is between 43% and 51%.

---
# Confidence Intervals vs Levels

- **Confidence Intervals** or two times the margin of error, measures the how sure we are of the answer given.
- **Confidence Level** measures how sure we are that the sample, if drawn again, would have the same result.

**Example**: If we are working with a sample size of 384, for a population of over 10 million people, we have a 5% margin of error using the 95% confidence level.

That means our confidence interval is plus or minus 5% on the sample statistic. 

If 52% of the population said they were very sure climate change was happening, we would say we are **95% sure** that the true percentage is **between 47% and 57%**.

If we wanted to narrow that range with the 3% margin of error, we'd **need 1067 responses** (not 384!)

# How: The Many Modes of Survey Administration

## How we connect to Respondents

- Online
- Mail
- Phone
- Text/SMS
- Web Panel
- Door to Door
- Intercept

Each of these involve some form of **recruitment** and may use multiple ways!

**Example**: Post card sent to household inviting to online survey. Follow up with paper survey for non-responses. Final phone call to explore response non-bias.

# How: The Many Modes of Survey Administration

## How we encourage Responses

- Make a Connection: Cover Letters and Design
- Partnerships: Trusted Entities
- Incentives
- Use your "Student Card"
- Consider Timing - Know your Population

## Response Rates

- Depends on: Non-Contact, Eligibility, <br> Partial Completion, Full Completion

# Measurement Challenges

---

background-image: url("img/reliable_valid.png")
background-position: 100% 75%
background-size: 350pt

# Measurement Challenges


- Are we measuring what we want to measure (**Validity**)?
- Are we successful when repeatedly using the measure (**Reliability**)?

## Some examples

- High Validity and High Reliability: <br> **Respondent's age**
- High Validity and Low Reliability: <br> **Assess classroom inclusion and climate**
- Low Validity and High Reliability: <br> **Are you racist?**
- Low Validity and Low Reliability: <br> **Do you support strenological expansion?**




???

"Strenological expansion" is made up. But its an example of things we could get very wrong if we focus on wonky ideas.

# Types of Questions

- Open Ended Questions: Text entry or "in their own words"
- Closed-Ended: Choices are pre-determined

- Other
   - Image Based
   - Participatory GIS
   - Text Interactions
   
   
---

# Choices on Question Design

.pull-left[
## Open-Ended
- Information rich (Good and Bad!)
- Does not prejudge right response
- Allows for uncertainty, where researcher does not know what to expect
- A **lot** of work to analyze
]

.pull-right[
## Close-Ended
- Researcher can control responses (analysis strength)
- Comparisons are easier
- Quicker for respondent
- You have to be very careful on choices you offer!
]
---

# Types of Close-Ended Questions

- Dichotomous
   - Yes or No, Checkbox Questions
- Categorical
   - Often demographic or descriptive
- Ordinal (or acting like it!)
   - Likert scale questions: Strongly Agree to Strongly Disagree
- Ratio (rare)
   - Money, thermometers, scales with sliders
   
---

# Anatomy of a Question (aka Item)

- Introduction
- Stem
- Response Options
   - Scale
   - Anchors
   - Odd vs Even Scales (5-pt or 4-pt)
   - Don't Know or Refusal Options
- Presentation Order
   - Questions can be randomized, or reversed
   - Scale can be randomized, or reversed
- Skip or Presentation Logic
   - Present questions based on other responses (aka Fork)
- Soft Requires and Hard Requires
   - Soft: Respondent offerred a second chance if they skip
   - Hard: Respondent can not proceed without answer (consent examople)

# Danger! Things to Avoid! `r emo::ji("dead")`

- Double Barrel Questions:<br> "Do you agree Renn Fayre is safe and fun?"

- Biased Questions:<br> "Do you support climate heroes working to stop oil companies?"

- Overly Leading: <br> "Do you love Reed College?"

- Ambiguous or Jargon-loaded:<br> "Do you never oppose fracking on BLM lands?"

- Mis-matched Stem and Response Options: <br> "Do you recycle at home? Every week, occsasisionally, never."

- Unbalanced Response Options:<br> "Disagree, Neither Agree nor Disasgree, Agree, Stronly Agree"

---

# Awesome! Things to Definately Do! `r emo::ji("heart")`

- Use Visual Design<br> White space, approachable design or colors, images.

- Language and Accessibility:<br> Can everyone in your population participate? Translation or other tools to help with accessibility?

- Make the Benefit Clear: <br> How can your research change the world?

- Incentives: Small tokens go a long way. Can be raffle or payment for all.

- Do no Harm:<br> Remember your ethical obligations, do no harm to respondents

# Preview on Analysis

## Response Rates and Weights

- Even if we draw the perfect sample, we miss some people.
- Use of weights to adjust results to capture over and under-representation

## Types of Weights

- **Design Weights**: We might add more people we know are likely to get missed into our sample draw.

- **Post-Stratification/Non-Response**: Once we have our sample, we can adjust to match population characteristics.

# Discuss Survey Codebook

## `r emo::ji("thinking")` What questions interested you?

## `r emo::ji("wizard")` What other variables would you use to understand question responses?

## `r emo::ji("juggle")` In groups: Discuss questions and analyses you might explore! (Keep these ideas, we will use them!)
